Hey there, I'm 0x5h31d0n, a curious tinkerer poking at the gears of the digital world. Picture me as a late-night coder, fueled by energy drinks and a stubborn urge to make things work—or spectacularly break them. This GitHub is my terminal window into chaos and creation.

You're in my home dir—a messy desk of code, scripts, and half-baked ideas. I mess with low-level stuff, tinker with networks, and occasionally wrestle with a debugger for fun. My projects are like my bash history: a mix of "that worked!" and "what was I thinking?"

Here's what's cluttering my workspace:

- shell_kiddie/   # Scripts that automate my laziness or prank my VMs
- packet_pal/     # A tool to sniff and visualize network chatter
- crash_course/   # Stress tests that make servers sweat
- wip_mystery/    # Something cool, but I forgot what it does

Check the repos yourself—some are polished, others are... let’s say "character-building."

I believe code should be clear enough to read at 3 AM but spicy enough to keep you awake. Open-source is my jam—fork my stuff, break it, make it better. If it crashes, we learn. If it runs, we celebrate. Either way, keep asking "why?"

Currently: Grinding through a tricky exploit challenge and losing to my own regex.  
Fun fact: My favorite bug is the one I *almost* caused in prod.  
Pro tip: Comment your code like you’re explaining it to your future, angrier self.

Thanks for poking around. Dig into my repos, file an issue, or just say hi. Let’s make something that either saves the day or gloriously implodes. Happy hacking!
