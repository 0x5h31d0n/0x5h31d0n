Hey there, I'm 0x5h31d0n, a curious tinkerer poking at the gears of the digital world. Picture me as a late-night coder, fueled by energy drinks and a stubborn urge to make things work—or spectacularly break them. This GitHub is my terminal window into chaos and creation.

You're in my home dir—a messy desk of code, scripts, and half-baked ideas. I mess with low-level stuff, tinker with networks, and occasionally wrestle with a debugger for fun. My projects are like my bash history: a mix of "that worked!" and "what was I thinking?"
